  Cameron, just before his team took to the ice for practice.  This was taken
  the first day of house league.  He told me not to take any more pictures
  about one second after this was taken.  I didn't listen.

  Before they got into practice the kids all did warmup laps around the rink
  several times.  Cameron's doing his best to keep up.

  During a part of practice where the kids were playing short games.  That's
  the coach on the right side, and the goalie is intense.
