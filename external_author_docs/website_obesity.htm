    <p>Let me start by saying that beautiful websites come in all sizes and page weights.  I love big websites packed with images. I love high-resolution video. I love sprawling Javascript experiments or well-designed web apps. 
    
    <p>This talk isn't about any of those. It's about mostly-text sites that, for unfathomable reasons, are growing bigger  with every passing year.
    
    <p>While I'll be using examples to keep the talk from getting too abstract, I’m not here to shame anyone, except some companies (Medium) that should know better and are intentionally breaking the web.

    <p>What do I mean by a website obesity crisis?  
    
    <p>Here’s an article on GigaOm from 2012 titled "<a href="https://gigaom.com/2012/05/23/the-growing-epidemic-of-page-bloat/">The Growing Epidemic of Page Bloat</a>".  It warns that the average web page is over a megabyte in size.  
    <p>The article itself is 1.8 megabytes long.

    <p>Here's an almost identical article from the same website two years later, called “<a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/12/29/the-overweight-web-average-web-page-size-is-up-15-in-2014/">The Overweight Web</a>".  This article warns that average page size is approaching 2 megabytes.  
    
    <p>That article is 3 megabytes long.
    
    <p>If present trends continue, there is the real chance that articles warning about page bloat could exceed 5 megabytes in size by 2020.
    
  <p> The problem with picking any particular size as a threshold is that it encourages us to define deviancy down. Today’s egregiously bloated site becomes tomorrow’s typical page, and next year’s elegantly slim design. 
  
  <p>I would like to anchor the discussion in something more timeless.

    <p>To repeat a suggestion I <a href="https://twitter.com/Pinboard/status/653714626857730048">made on Twitter</a>, I contend that <b>text-based websites should not exceed in size the major works of Russian literature</b>.

<p>This is a generous yardstick. I could have picked French literature, full of slim little books, but I intentionally went with Russian novels and their reputation for ponderousness.

<p>In Goncharov's <a href="http://www.powells.com/book/oblomov-9780300162288">Oblomov</a>, for example, the title character spends the first hundred pages just getting out of bed.

    <p>In May 2015, <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com">Facebook introduced ‘Instant Articles’</a>, a special format for news stories designed to appear within the Facebook site, and to load nearly instantly.  
    
    <p>Facebook made the announcement on a 6.8 megabyte webpage dominated by a giant headshot of some dude. He doesn’t even work for Facebook, he’s just the National Geographic photo editor.

   <p>Further down the page, you'll find a 41 megabyte video, the only way to find out more about the project.  In the video, this editor rhapsodizes about exciting misfeatures of the new instant format like tilt-to-pan images, which means if you don't hold your phone steady, the photos will drift around like a Ken Burns documentary.

    <p>You're welcome to buy as much of it as you want, but it costs a fortune and comes in tiny portions. And after the third or fourth purchase, people start to look at you funny.

<p>Google has rolled out a competitor to Instant Articles, which it calls <a href="https://www.ampproject.org">Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>.  AMP is a special subset of HTML designed to be fast on mobile devices.  

<p>Why not just serve regular HTML without stuffing it full of useless crap? The question is left unanswered.    

<p>The AMP project is ostentatiously open source, and all kinds of publishers have signed on.   Out of an abundance of love for the mobile web, Google has volunteered to run the infrastructure, especially the user tracking parts of it.

  <p> If you open it in Safari, where the carousel is broken, the page still manages to fill 4 megabytes.
   
    <p>These comically huge homepages for projects designed to make the web faster are the equivalent of watching a fitness video where the presenter is just standing there, eating pizza and cookies.

<p>To channel a famous motivational speaker, I could go out there tonight, with the materials you’ve got, and rewrite the sites I showed you at the start of this talk to make them load in under a second.  In two hours.  

<p>Can you?  Can you?

<p>Of course you can! It’s not hard!  We knew how to make small websites in 2002. It’s not like the secret has been lost to history, like Greek fire or Damascus steel.

<p>But we face pressure to make these sites bloated.

<p>I bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you’d be fired. Even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. It’s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.

<p>If you've ever struggled to lose weight, you know there are tricks people use to fool themselves into thinking they're thinner. You suck in your gut, wear a tight shirt, stand on a certain part of the scale. 

<p>The same situation obtains with performance testing. People have invented creative metrics to persuade themselves that their molasses-like websites load fast.

<p>Google has a popular one called <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index">SpeedIndex</a>. (You know it's from Google because they casually throw an integral sign into the definition.) 

<p>SpeedIndex is based on the idea that what  counts is how fast the visible part of the website renders.  It doesn't matter what's happening elsewhere on the page. It doesn't matter if the network is saturated and your phone is hot to the touch.  It doesn't matter if the battery is visibly draining. Everything is OK as long as the part of the site in the viewport appears to pop into view right away.

<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter how fast the site appears to load if the first thing the completed page does is serve an interstitial ad.  Or, if like many mobile users, you  start scrolling immediately and catch the 'unoptimized' part of the page with its pants down.

<p>There is only one honest measure of web performance: <b>the time from when you click a link to when you've finished skipping the last ad</b>.

<p>Everything else is bullshit.

<p>In conversations with web performance advocates, I sometimes feel like a hippie talking to SUV owners about fuel economy.

<p>They have all kinds of weirdly specific tricks to improve mileage. Deflate the front left tire a little bit. Put a magnet on the gas cap. Fold in the side mirrors.  

<p>Most of the talk about web performance is similarly technical, involving compression, asynchronous loading, sequencing assets, batching HTTP requests,  pipelining, and minification.

    <p>Nutritionists used to be big on this concept of a food pyramid. I think we need one for the web, to remind ourselves of what a healthy site should look like.</p>
    
<p>Here is what I recommend for a balanced website in 2015:

<ul>
<li><p>A solid base of text worth reading, formatted with a healthy dose of markup. </li>
<li><p>Some images, in moderation, to illustrate and punch up the visual design.</li>
<li><p>A dollop of CSS.</li>
<li><p>And then, very sparingly and only if you need it, JavaScript.</li>

<p>Web designers! It's not all your fault.

<p>You work your heart out to create a nice site, optimized for performance. You spend the design process trying to anticipate the user’s needs and line their path with rose petals.

<p>Then, after all this work is done, your client makes you shit all over your hard work by adding tracking scripts and ads that you have no control over, whose origin and content will be decided at the moment the page loads in the user’s browser, and whose entire purpose is to break your design and distract the user from whatever they came to the site to do.

<p>The user's experience of your site is dominated by hostile elements  out of your control.

The page is 12 megabytes in size in a stock web browser.
  

 <p>The same article with basic ad blocking turned on is one megabyte.  It’s no model of parsimony, but still, what a difference a plugin makes.
 
 <p>If you look at what the unblocked version pulls in, it’s not just videos and banner ads, but file after file of javascript. Every beacon, tracker and sharing button has its own collection of scripts that it needs to fetch from a third-party server.  Each request comes packed with cookies.
 
 <p>More cookies are the last thing your overweight website needs.
 
 <p>These scripts get served from God knows where and are the perfect vector for malware.
 
 <p>Advertisers will tell you it has to be this way, but in dealing with advertisers you must remember they are professional liars.  
 
 <p>I don’t mean this to offend.  I mean it as a job description.  An advertiser's  job is to convince you to do stuff you would not otherwise do. Their task in talking to web designers is to persuade them that the only way to show ads is by including mountains of third-party cruft and tracking.  
 
 <p>The bloat, performance, and security awfulness, they argue, is the price readers pay for free content.

    <p>It has equally enormous buttons, but the only piece of information I'm interested in—the price of the flight on each day—appears in microscopic type under the date.
    
    <p>My gripe with this design aesthetic is the loss of information density. I'm an adult human being sitting at a large display, with a mouse and keyboard.  I deserve better.

    <p>Everyone recognizes that it's challenging to make a site that looks good at all screen sizes.  
    
    <p>But the emphasis on screen size has obscured an important difference in how people interact with interface elements. 
    
    <p>On a phone, people are poking at a small screen with the meat styluses hanging off their arms.  In that scenario, it makes sense to have big buttons.
    
    <p>On a large screen, where you have acres of space and an exquisitely sensitive pointing device, the same interface is maddening.
    
    <p>There may be no way to split the difference.  I feel like designers are just waiting for us all to stop using laptops.</p>

    <p>But notice how some elements are tiny, and some are huge.  Half the page is in the idiom of touch interfaces, and the whole thing is hard to read.

<p>There was always a catch.  The gas burners on the stoves were kind of small. The handles would occasionally fall off the frying pans, at unexpected times. 

<p>And to their credit, Amazon warned you about this up front, and told you to design your procedures with failures in mind. 

<p>Some things were guaranteed to never fail—the freezers, say, would always stay below freezing.  But maybe you wouldn't be able to unlock the doors for several hours at a time.

<p>As people began moving to the cloud, it forced them to think at a  bigger scale. They had to think in terms of multiple machines and availability zones, and that meant thinking about redundancy, failure tolerance. 

<p>All of these are good things at scale, but overkill for a lot of smaller sites. You don't need an entire restaurant kitchen staff to fry an egg.

 <p>The point is not that people using Hadoop clusters are foolish, or that everything can be done on a laptop.  It's that many people's intuition about what constitutes a large system does not reflect the reality of 2015 hardware.

    <p>Let me give you a concrete example.  I recently heard from a competitor, let’s call them ACME Bookmarking Co., who are looking to leave the bookmarking game and sell their website. 
    
    <p>While ACME has much more traffic than I do, I learned they only have half the daily active users. This was reassuring, because the hard part of scaling a bookmarking site is dealing with people saving stuff.   
    
    <p>We both had the same number of employees.  They have an intern working on the project part time, while I dither around and travel the world giving talks. Say half a full-time employee for each of us.
    
    <p>We have similar revenue per active user.  I gross $12,000 a month, they gross $5,000.
    
    <p>But where the projects differ radically is cost. ACME hosts their service on AWS, and at one point they were paying $23,000 (!!) in monthly  fees.   Through titanic effort, they have been able to reduce that to $9,000 a month. 
    
    <p>I pay just over a thousand dollars a month for hosting, using my own equipment.  That figure includes the amortized cost of my hardware, and sodas from the vending machine at the colo.
    
    <p>So while I consider bookmarking a profitable business, to them it's a $4,000/month money pit.  I'm living large off the same income stream that is driving them to sell  their user data to marketers and get the hell out of the game.

  <p>The point is that assumptions about complexity will anchor your expectations, and limit what you're willing to try.   If you think a 'real' website has to live in the cloud and run across a dozen machines, a whole range of otherwise viable projects will seem unprofitable.  
  
  <p>Similarly, if you think you need a many-layered CMS and extensive custom javascript for an online publishing venture, the range of things you will try becomes very constricted. 
  
  <p>Rather than trying to make your overbuilt projects look simple, ask yourself if they can't just <i>be</i> simple.

<p>I don't want to harsh on the cloud.  Some of my best friends are in the cloud.

<p>Rather, I want to remind everyone there’s plenty of room at the bottom. Developers today work on top of too many layers to notice how powerful the technology has become. It’s a reverse princess-and-the-pea problem.  

<p>The same thing happens in the browser. The core technology is so fast and good that we’ve been able to pile crap on top of it and still have it work tolerably well.  

<p>One way to make your website shine is by having the courage to let the browser do what it's optimized to do.   Don't assume that all your frameworks and tooling are saving you time or money.

<p>Unfortunately, complexity has become a bit of a bragging point. People boast to one another about what's in their 'stack', and share tips about how to manage it.

<p>"Stack" is the backend equivalent to the word "polyfill". Both of them are signs that you are radically overcomplicating your design.

    <p>There's a reason to care about this beyond just aesthetics and efficiency.
    
    <p>Let me use a computer game analogy to express two visions of the future Web.
    
<p>The first vision is the Web as Minecraft—an open world with simple pieces that obey simple rules.  The graphics are kind of clunky, but that’s not the point, and nobody cares.   

<p>In this vision, you are meant to be an active participant, you're supposed to create stuff, and you'll have the most fun when you collaborate with others.

<p>The other vision is of the web as Call of Duty—an exquisitely produced, kind-of-but-not-really-participatory guided experience with breathtaking effects and lots of opportunities to make in-game purchases.  

<p>Creating this kind of Web requires a large team of specialists. No one person can understand the whole pipeline, nor is anyone expected to.  Even if someone could master all the technologies in play, the production costs would be prohibitive.

<p>The user experience in this kind of Web is that of being carried along, with the illusion of agency, within fairly strict limits.   There's an obvious path you're supposed to follow, and disincentives to keep you straying from it.  As a bonus, the game encodes a whole problematic political agenda. The only way to reject it is not to play.  

<p>Despite the lavish production values, there's a strange sameness to everything. You're always in the same brown war zone.

<p>With great effort and skill, you might be able make minor modifications to this game world. But most people will end up playing exactly the way the publishers intend.  It's passive entertainment with occasional button-mashing.

   <p>Here's the hortatory part of the talk:</p>

<p>Let’s preserve the web as the hypertext medium it is, the only thing of its kind in the world, and not turn it into another medium for consumption, like we have so many examples of already.

<p>Let’s commit to the idea that as computers get faster, and as networks get faster, the web should also get faster.

<p>Let’s not allow the panicked dinosaurs of online publishing to trample us as they stampede away from the meteor. Instead, let's hide in our holes and watch nature take its beautiful course.

<p>Most importantly, let’s break the back of the online surveillance establishment that threatens not just our livelihood, but our liberty.  Not only here in Australia, but in America, Europe, the UK—in every free country where the idea of permanent, total surveillance sounded like bad science fiction even ten years ago.

    <p>The way to keep giant companies from sterilizing the Internet is to make their sites irrelevant.  If all the cool stuff happens elsewhere, people will follow.  We did this with AOL and Prodigy, and we can do it again.
    
    <p>For this to happen, it's vital that the web stay participatory.  That means not just making sites small enough so the whole world can visit them, but small enough so that people can learn to build their own, by example.
