  Took a little while to figure out which was Cameron's permanent home
  amongst the house leagues.  He's on the Bantam red team now, and this
  was from his first time playing with them.

  The kids go through all sorts of drills.  This was from one where the
  kids had to alternate roles.  He's playing defense.

  The coach works one-on-one with Cameron to level up his passing skill.
