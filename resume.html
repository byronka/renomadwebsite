<h4>Companies I have worked for</h4>

<p>
<em>Coveros</em> 2017-present, a 60-person consultancy in Virginia suburbs outside Washington D.C.<br>
title: Senior Technical Consultant
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Taught and coached in modern software development practices to groups ranging from private individuals to some of the largest international organizations.  Topics included: modern agile engineering, test-driven development, behavior-driven development, test automation and proper testing practices.
  </li>

  <li>
    Developed software used as a teaching material and reference for best practices, found at https://github.com/7ep/demo
  </li> 

  <li>
    Ran an internal teaching initiative to improve the abilities of the consultants in innovative software development techniques
  </li>

  <li>
    Demonstrated value of careful refactoring, addition of unit tests, and comments on legacy code. Doing so uncovered multitudes of long-standing defects.
  </li>

  <li>
    Rewrote portion of code in Healthcare.gov that generated data for reports. While doing so, took the time to become familiar with the domain, thereby discovering undefined requirements which led to greater precision from stakeholders.
  </li>

  <li>
    Involved with first development efforts on a new healthcare provider registration system for Medicare, called PECOS 2.0. Provided considerable technical guidance and mentoring in the subject areas of team process, data modeling, code quality, and devops.
  </li>

  <li>
    Refactored the data provisioning system to be independent of the main application, to allow greater versatility in different stages, as well as during the development cycle.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
<em>CoStar</em> 2015-2017, the world's leading database of commercial real estate data<br>
title: Senior Developer
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  One of the pages was taking up to a minute to render using old, sluggish XML-XSLT technology. Rewrote using KnockoutJS and MVC RESTful endpoints, causing average page loads to
  take less than a second, and for client-side sorting actions to be near instantaneous.
  </li>
  <li>
  In a series of lectures and workshops, taught Git to team.
  </li>
  <li>
  Researched techniques for rewriting our client-controlled report generator. After thoughtful vetting of many alternatives, suggested using HTML-to-PDF rendering for templated HTML.  This is now used on all new reports.
  </li>
  <li>
   Assisted systems team in starting to use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
  </li>
  <li>
  One of the tools that we use for performance analysis indicated that there were many opportunities for improvements in our SQL queries. Two of us analyzed a variety of queries, taking them apart and rebuilding, to see where we could find optimizations for speed while maintaining correctness. We sped up the system 33%.
  </li>
  <li>
  Demonstrated the benefits of adding thoughtful comments throughout the code base to illuminate the way for maintenance programmers.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Portman Architects</em> 2005-2009<br>
title: staff architect
</p>
<p>
  Architectural design and assistant project manager during design and construction of $300 million Hilton Bayfront Hotel in San Diego
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Coordination with consultants and contractors
  </li>
  <li>
  Point of contact for all requests for information
  </li>
  <li>
  Code analysis
  </li>
  <li>
  Creation and drafting of functional and aesthetic design and detailing
  </li>

  Site review
  </li>
  <li>
  Permit process assistance to developer
  </li>
  <li>
  Design types: 1200 room convention hotel, university library, podium levels of high rise tower.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
During the San Diego Hilton project, I developed an excellent rapport
with all consultants and the Contractor and Owner, resulting in
1) a greater number of successful actions between all parties
2) improved efficiency in the Request For Information (RFI) process
3) timelier responses from all parties
4) greater effort from all associated parties to assist as a team,
resulting in less effort and time required by the Architect.  This
greater efficiency led to less time required for all tasks and increased
quality of work.
<br>
Developed unusual details, taking into account multiple avenues of
research and consultation.  Emphasized low-maintenance, longevity, and
durability in design.  For example, I detailed the steam room in the
spa.  This required intensive research in tile details, waterproofing
details,  and steam machine details, as well as reviewing the
specifications and consulting with a waterproofing consultant.  The
result was a set of drawings which included all necessary provisions to
build a steam room which would work for a long time with low
maintenance.  In another instance, I designed a "hidden" door behind the
front reception desk which had unusual constraints:  It was curved, was
on a smoke and fire barrier, had to have electronic security, and was
intended to conceal itself by blending in with the rest of the wall..
This required research and consultation with the General Contractor and
sub-contractors, our door consultant, security consultant, and
electrical consultant, as well as the Owner.  In the end, we had built a
door which successfully blended in with its surroundings and solved all
of the problems within budget

<h4>Commendations</h4>
<p>
Byron seems to be able to strike the delicate balance of listening, thinking, and suggesting smart
solutions to problems. He seems to be intent on leveling up our team members. Whether it’s introducing new development tools such as Vi or other *nix commands, or going deep on Git and then
teaching the rest of us what he learned, he seems to want to share his knowledge for the betterment
of his peers. This philosophy is infectious and I would expect that other team members will be
following his lead in learning a topic and teaching others.
<br>
He successfully delivered the rework of the Property survey page. As simple as that page may seem,
it has a large set of small features that needed to be re-worked. The rework of the survey page had
a dramatic effect on a number of user’s experiences as previously, this page took minutes to render
for clients with large survey lists. Now it takes a couple of seconds at most.
<br>
I would like to see Byron contribute to a large effort such as the reconceptualization of our web
application structure. I’m not sure if Byron could lead this effort or simply contribute, but his way
of thinking would guarantee a positive contribution.
<br>
Byron uses probably the most diverse set of tools on the team. Understands multiple tool chains
including *nix based and leverages those as needed to optimize his workflow. Probably, if given time
and given the opportunity, he would vastly improve the core product workflow.

<p>
I highly recommend Byron Katz as a candidate for employment. Byron and I worked on the same
team at the NCI Center for Bioinformatics. Byron’s technical ability and contribution was very
strong and coupled with his resourcefulness and unwavering persistence he set himself apart from
all of his peers. He was not only affable, but extremely reliable and was adept with working with all
levels - from technical colleagues to senior leadership. Byron would be a tremendous asset to any
organization and has my highest recommendation.
</p>
- Steve Young, colleague at NCI
<br>
<p>
Byron has excellent communication skills, has solid working relationships and is extremely organized and detail oriented. I was able to rely on him in completing his assignments from typical to
complex technical issues in a timely manner using good judgment with sound decisions and recommendations. He takes great pride in his work.
