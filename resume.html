    I have experience at software firms ranging from start-ups to large
    enterprises to government projects. My primary project experience
    has been as a full-stack developer of multi-tier web projects in
    Java and .Net, but most recently I have had the opportunity to teach
    best practices in software development and testing. I enjoy making
    valuable concepts accessible to a larger audience, and I want
    to persuade others that the costs of quality, simplicity, and beauty
    pay for themselves in the long run.

  You’ve brought the Common Purpose to life by improving teammates’ and athletes’ experiences ordering custom golf equipment through the delivery of TeeBox.  ... we have seen a positive reduction in the number of custom orders cancellations and have made teammates’ jobs easier.  Additionally, you have been a foundational pillar for the positive onboarding of the entire engineering team in the custom products space.  Your actions and contributions have not gone unnoticed.  Thank you again for all you’ve done for our team and company.  You are a valued teammate!

  The instructor (Byron) really knew his stuff, and did an excellent
  job explaining it while keeping us interested and engaged. It was
  great to see the light bulbs going off above people's heads
  (including my own) that "hey, this is actually something that's
  possible and we can start doing right now!" The positive effects
  will be magnified many times over as we spread this throughout our
  organization.
  </p>
  - student from software testing class
  <br>

  <p>
  Technically: this project has been a joy to work on. Fearless experimentation and inquisition has led us in unexpected directions, not always fruitful to the source code but always helpful to my understanding. This has been a great experience for both learning Kotlin and internalizing the norms of test-driven development.
  <br>
  Interpersonally: Ideas lead. Never once have I felt pressured by the authority of seniority or expertise, and the result has been a welcoming and safe atmosphere that makes me feel more confident in my skills as a coder and a learner. Speaking personally, your confidence (Byron) that we can create something truly excellent is infectious, and something I didn’t know I was missing before.
  </p>
  - Mitch Hardee, junior developer at Coveros, speaking about work on the "Lab" initiative
  <br>

  <p>
  Byron seems to be able to strike the delicate balance of listening, thinking, and suggesting smart
  solutions to problems. He seems to be intent on leveling up our team members. Whether it’s introducing new development tools such as Vi or other *nix commands, or going deep on Git and then
  teaching the rest of us what he learned, he seems to want to share his knowledge for the betterment
  of his peers. This philosophy is infectious and I would expect that other team members will be
  following his lead in learning a topic and teaching others.
  <br>
  He successfully delivered the rework of the Property survey page. As simple as that page may seem,
  it has a large set of small features that needed to be re-worked. The rework of the survey page had
  a dramatic effect on a number of user’s experiences as previously, this page took minutes to render
  for clients with large survey lists. Now it takes a couple of seconds at most.
  <br>
  I would like to see Byron contribute to a large effort such as the reconceptualization of our web
  application structure. I’m not sure if Byron could lead this effort or simply contribute, but his way
  of thinking would guarantee a positive contribution.
  <br>
  Byron uses probably the most diverse set of tools on the team. Understands multiple tool chains
  including *nix based and leverages those as needed to optimize his workflow. Probably, if given time
  and given the opportunity, he would vastly improve the core product workflow.
  </p>
  - Joel Rumerman, manager at CoStar Group
  <br>

  <p>
  I highly recommend Byron Katz as a candidate for employment. Byron and I worked on the same
  team at the NCI Center for Bioinformatics. Byron’s technical ability and contribution was very
  strong and coupled with his resourcefulness and unwavering persistence he set himself apart from
  all of his peers. He was not only affable, but extremely reliable and was adept with working with all
  levels - from technical colleagues to senior leadership. Byron would be a tremendous asset to any
  organization and has my highest recommendation.
  </p>
  - Steve Young, colleague at NCI
  <br>
  <p>
  Byron has excellent communication skills, has solid working relationships and is extremely organized and detail oriented. I was able to rely on him in completing his assignments from typical to
  complex technical issues in a timely manner using good judgment with sound decisions and recommendations. He takes great pride in his work.
