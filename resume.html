“I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.”<br> - Kent Beck
</p>

<p>
  <em>Quick summary</em>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    2002 graduate of University of Tennessee, with a degree in architecture (bachelor of architecture five year degree). Became licensed as an architect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hired as software tester in 2010 at National Cancer Institute. Became lead QA within four months.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I have been in love with computers since my father bought the family a
  Commodore 64 in the eighties. I have diverse experience, having been an
  architect, an entrepreneur, a software tester, a trainer, and a developer.
<p>
<p>
<em>Mission statement</em><br>
<ul>
  <li>Mentor staff in world-class quality-oriented development techniques</li>
  <li>Contribute to building reputation for company as bright beacon for innovation and excellence</li>
  <li>Explore innovative approaches</li>
  <li>Build a culture of psychological safety and joy</li>
</ul>
</p>
</p>
  I have experience at software firms ranging from start-ups to large
  enterprises to government projects. My primary project experience
  has been as a full-stack developer of multi-tier web projects in
  Java and .Net, but most recently I have had the opportunity to teach
  best practices in software development and testing. I enjoy making
  valuable concepts accessible to a larger audience, and I want
  to persuade others that the costs of quality, simplicity, and beauty
  pay for themselves in the long run.
</p>
<p>
<em>My characteristics</em><br>
<ul>
  <li>I have written hundreds of thousands of lines of code.</li>
  <li>I am committed to quality.</li>
  <li>I love programming, and love to work with others who do.</li>
  <li>I believe pair programming with test-driven development is the best practice</li>
  <li>I believe deep understanding makes it possible to explain complex ideas in simple terms.</li>
  <li>I believe that software development is more a function of social aspects than technical concepts</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Portman Architects</em> 2005-2009<br>
title: staff architect
</p>
<p>
  Architectural design and assistant project manager during design and construction of $300 million Hilton Bayfront Hotel in San Diego
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Coordination with consultants and contractors
  </li>
  <li>
  Point of contact for all requests for information
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
<p>
During the San Diego Hilton project, I developed an excellent rapport
with all consultants and the Contractor and Owner, resulting in
<ol>
    <li>
      a greater number of successful actions between all parties
    </li>
    <li>
      improved efficiency in the Request For Information (RFI) process
    </li>
    <li>
      timelier responses from all parties
    </li>
    <li>
      greater effort from all associated parties to assist as a team,
      resulting in less effort and time required by the Architect.  This
      greater efficiency led to less time required for all tasks and increased
      quality of work.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
Developed unusual details, taking into account multiple avenues of
research and consultation.  Emphasized low-maintenance, longevity, and
durability in design.
<br>
For example, I detailed the steam room in the
spa.  This required intensive research in tile details, waterproofing
details,  and steam machine details, as well as reviewing the
specifications and consulting with a waterproofing consultant.  The
result was a set of drawings which included all necessary provisions to
build a steam room which would work for a long time with low
maintenance.  
<br>
In another instance, I designed a "hidden" door behind the
front reception desk which had unusual constraints:  It was curved, was
on a smoke and fire barrier, had to have electronic security, and was
intended to conceal itself by blending in with the rest of the wall..
This required research and consultation with the General Contractor and
sub-contractors, our door consultant, security consultant, and
electrical consultant, as well as the Owner.  In the end, we had built a
door which successfully blended in with its surroundings and solved all
of the problems within budget

<h4>Commendations</h4>
<p>
You’ve brought the Common Purpose to life by improving teammates’ and athletes’ experiences ordering custom golf equipment through the delivery of TeeBox.  ... we have seen a positive reduction in the number of custom orders cancellations and have made teammates’ jobs easier.  Additionally, you have been a foundational pillar for the positive onboarding of the entire engineering team in the custom products space.  Your actions and contributions have not gone unnoticed.  Thank you again for all you’ve done for our team and company.  You are a valued teammate!
</p>
- Jason Guttman, technical manager at Dick's Sporting Goods
<br>

<p>
Technically: this project has been a joy to work on. Fearless experimentation and inquisition has led us in unexpected directions, not always fruitful to the source code but always helpful to my understanding. This has been a great experience for both learning Kotlin and internalizing the norms of test-driven development.
<br>
Interpersonally: Ideas lead. Never once have I felt pressured by the authority of seniority or expertise, and the result has been a welcoming and safe atmosphere that makes me feel more confident in my skills as a coder and a learner. Speaking personally, your confidence (Byron) that we can create something truly excellent is infectious, and something I didn’t know I was missing before.
</p>
- Mitch Hardee, junior developer at Coveros, speaking about work on the "Lab" initiative
<br>

<p>
Byron seems to be able to strike the delicate balance of listening, thinking, and suggesting smart
solutions to problems. He seems to be intent on leveling up our team members. Whether it’s introducing new development tools such as Vi or other *nix commands, or going deep on Git and then
teaching the rest of us what he learned, he seems to want to share his knowledge for the betterment
of his peers. This philosophy is infectious and I would expect that other team members will be
following his lead in learning a topic and teaching others.
<br>
He successfully delivered the rework of the Property survey page. As simple as that page may seem,
it has a large set of small features that needed to be re-worked. The rework of the survey page had
a dramatic effect on a number of user’s experiences as previously, this page took minutes to render
for clients with large survey lists. Now it takes a couple of seconds at most.
<br>
I would like to see Byron contribute to a large effort such as the reconceptualization of our web
application structure. I’m not sure if Byron could lead this effort or simply contribute, but his way
of thinking would guarantee a positive contribution.
<br>
Byron uses probably the most diverse set of tools on the team. Understands multiple tool chains
including *nix based and leverages those as needed to optimize his workflow. Probably, if given time
and given the opportunity, he would vastly improve the core product workflow.
</p>
- Joel Rumerman, manager at CoStar Group
<br>

<p>
I highly recommend Byron Katz as a candidate for employment. Byron and I worked on the same
team at the NCI Center for Bioinformatics. Byron’s technical ability and contribution was very
strong and coupled with his resourcefulness and unwavering persistence he set himself apart from
all of his peers. He was not only affable, but extremely reliable and was adept with working with all
levels - from technical colleagues to senior leadership. Byron would be a tremendous asset to any
organization and has my highest recommendation.
</p>
- Steve Young, colleague at NCI
<br>
<p>
Byron has excellent communication skills, has solid working relationships and is extremely organized and detail oriented. I was able to rely on him in completing his assignments from typical to
complex technical issues in a timely manner using good judgment with sound decisions and recommendations. He takes great pride in his work.
