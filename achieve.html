<p>
  Hello,
</p>
  My name is Byron Katz, and I have been in the software development game just about my entire life.
</p>

<p>
  I was using a 300 baud modem with a Commodore 64 in 1986.  I wrote a game with my best friend for the Apple //e in 1990 (https://github.com/byronka/find_the_blob).  I was playing with FreeBSD and Red Hat Linux, and had classes in Pascal during high school in 1995.
</p>

<p>
  The river of our lives takes circuitous paths, thus I decided I would major in architecture during college - and not the software kind.  It was tons of fun seeing my designs become reality in the form of concrete and steel.  However, I began to realize that I still held an abiding love for software.  
</p>

<p>
  In 2008 an opportunity arose to jump back into that world for a deeper dive.  I took it, working as a quality assurance engineer for the National Institutes of Health.  Eventually I transitioned into software development - I like making things much better than analyzing them.
</p>

<p>
  My first work in software development was at a small company (at the time) called Thycotic Software.  Yes, ridiculous name.  But they were a group of wizardly programmers, and I was thrilled to be amongst them.  
</p>

<p>
  That was where I had my first, and so far only, real Agile software experience.  Subsequent positions often claimed Agile, but none really were.  I am able to wax poetic about the benefits, but they are only available to those who are able to wholly claim and control their culture - a rarity when dealing with government or large corporate work.
</p>

<p>
  I find that at this point in my career, I am most interested in doing something deeply meaningful and real.  I would like to help create something that has a positive impact on the world, and helps people, something which brings obvious value to end-users particularly.
</p>

<p>
  I don't like irony.  I would rather have most of my energy and capability go towards production rather than politicking or make-work.  
</p>
<p>
Some of my greatest achievements:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Within 4 months of being a software QA for the first time ever, I was made technical and team lead.</li>
<li>I've been nominated for technical manager at recent jobs by my manager and the senior Vice President.</li>
<li>I've given numerous interesting presentations on technical subjects for the entire development department at multiple companies.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I have taught myself what was needed in order to be a competent and
esteemed software developer.  I was responsible for mentoring my
fellow developers in some key technologies.  I have written
applications on Android that have a thousand users.  I have been an
entrepreneur (I ran a profitable architecture firm).  I have worked as a
software QA engineer and QA team lead that helped a project meet all
its goals.  I was one of the primary architects for a $300 million
hotel project in San Diego.  
</p>


<p>
I bring to the table a strong work ethic, a passion for craft, and a focus on quality. I am driven by an inner compass towards
producing work with longevity, simplicity, and beauty. I have developed soft-skills and a knowledge base that, I hope, lead
my colleagues and managers to consider me a commensurate professional.
</p>

<p>
This has not come cheaply to me. It is the result of continuous years
of focus and drive, during and after work hours, in a variety of
professional and creative situations. This is decades worth of
hard-won professionalism which comes into use every day. 
</p>

<p>
From being one of the lead architects on several large
building designs, to owning my own company, to being a self-taught developer. From becoming a QA team lead, to
publishing my own applications, and then finally to my present position as Senior Software Engineer at an excellent firm. 
</p>

<p>
I love learning, and it shows in the depth and breadth of what I can demonstrate.  Programming languages: C#, Java, SQL, JavaScript, C, Haskell, Forth, Basic, x86 Assembly, Perl, Python, Scheme.  Networking.  Operating systems.  The list just goes on and on.  And so does my quest for more.
</p>
<p>
Teaching myself is not enough.  I strive to be the very best, capable of leading by example.  I intend to keep going as long as I am able.
</p>
<p>
All this has left me a rounded, capable,
motivated person who takes a long-term view, demands high quality,
and properly assesses different kinds of risk.
<p>
