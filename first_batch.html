  <p>David had a Minecraft-themed birthday party.  It was amazing.  Ben, Steve, and I took turns wearing "Steve" and "Creeper" masks and walked around getting hit by the kids' foam swords.  Susanne made sure there were plenty of activities, and the food was good.  Especially Susanne's famous chocolate-frosted birthday cake.</p>
