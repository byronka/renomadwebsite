		<p>Recipe: Oatmeal Raisin Cookies
		Adapted from Melissa Weller of Sadelle’s, New York City
		By Charlotte Druckman
</p>

<p>
		Ms. Weller uses Quaker Old-Fashioned Oats. She prefers them to
		both the quick-cooking and steel-cut varieties. You can choose a
		different brand, so long as they’re marked “old-fashioned” or
		“rolled.” You don’t have to let the dough rest four days before
		baking, but the depth of flavor you’ll get makes the cookies more than
		worth the wait.
</p>

<p>
		Active Time: 10-15 minutes Total Time: 1 hour, plus 4 days for
		chilling dough Makes: 14 cookies
</p>


<pre>
	1 cup raisins
	1¼ cups all-purpose flour
	1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	2 teaspoons baking soda
	1½ teaspoons fine sea salt
	1½ sticks slightly softened butter
	1 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
	6 tablespoons granulated sugar
	2 cups old-fashioned or rolled oats
	1 extra-large egg
	1½ teaspoons vanilla extract
</pre>

    <ol>
<li>
		Soak raisins in hot water for 30 minutes, then drain.
</li>

<li>
		Meanwhile, in a small bowl, sift together flour, cinnamon,
		baking soda and salt.
</li>

<li>
		Using an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream
		together butter and sugars on medium speed until light and fluffy,
		scraping down frequently. Take care not to overbeat.  Advertisement
</li>

<li>
		Add flour mixture to creamed butter and sugar and mix on low
		speed until combined. Mix in oats, followed by drained raisins, egg
		and vanilla.
</li>

<li>
		Use a ¼-cup measure to scoop dough onto a parchment-paper lined
		baking sheet. Flatten each blob with base of measuring cup. Cover
		baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 days (optional).
</li>

		<li>To bake cookies: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake until
		cookies are golden-brown on the outside but still soft in the middle,
		about 17 minutes. Remove from oven and let rest on baking sheet a few
		minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool. </li> 
</ol>
