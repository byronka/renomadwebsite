    We were comparing diff-viewer tools at work today
  </p>
    <div class="date">June 3, 2014</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    Say you had a situation where someone changed code and also
    used line breaks to reformat the code.  Most diff-viewer tools won't
    handle that situation very well.  They indicate important changes
    where it is merely a formatting change - an unimportant change, for
    the most part.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    What we want to is for our diff viewer to ignore the carriage returns
    as just more white space.
</p>
  <p class="content-body">
    A good way to handle this follows: We know that "C like" languages
    are often allowed to ignore whitespace (using symbols like
    parenthesis, semicolon, and curly brackets to demarcate code).  We
    can simply tokenize the input, put each token on its own line,
    and then diff that.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    Let's see these files.
  </p>
  <p class="content-subheader">
    test1.c
</p>
    <pre><code class=" language-c"
>int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (a && b && c && d) {
    printf("Hello diff!\n");
  }
}</code></pre>
  <p class="content-subheader">
    test2.c
</p>

<pre><code class=" language-c"
>int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (a 
      && b 
      && c 
      && d) {
    printf("Hello diff!\n");
  }
}</code></pre>

<p class="content-subheader">
diff before and after using our tokenizing trick
</p>
<pre><code class=" language-bash"
>$ diff -q  test1.c test2.c
Files test1.c and test2.c differ

$ diff -q  \
> <(tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' < test2.c) \
> <(tr -s '[[:space:]]' '\n' < test1.c)
$ 
</code></pre>

<p class="content-body">
  So diff is telling us they don't differ in the second case.
