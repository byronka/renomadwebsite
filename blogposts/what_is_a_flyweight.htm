    What is a flyweight?
  </p>

    Took me a while to get this one.  At first I understood it to mean
    the following:
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    We have a fat object.  It has lots of sub-objects, strings in it, lots
    of data, and so on.  Maybe we want to skinny it up, especially if we
    are using that object a lot (we would find ourselves using a lot of
    memory).
  </p>

  <p class="content-body">
    So my initial understanding was that Flyweight pattern is simply
    skinnying up an object.  Take the repeated common parts out of it,
    and make them references. 
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    By the way, flyweight historically meant the class of boxer that is
    very light-weight, under 112 lbs.
  </p>

  <p class="content-body">
    That initial understanding was 80% of the way there.  The only
    thing left is to understand that with flyweight objects, it is
    just a cache of those repeated common parts.  Let's say one of the
    properties of an object is a string for its name.  We won't allow
    each object created to have its name bound along with the object,
    using all that memory.  Instead, we will use a method to access
    and store to the cache for that value.  To make this more
    concrete, see here:
  </p>
<pre><code class="language-c" >lookupName(name) {
    if name does not exist,
        store it in the cache,
    return the object containing name from cache
}</code></pre>
