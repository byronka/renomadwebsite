		Unnecessary complexity

<p class="content-body">
The cognitive load in programming just keeps going up for no valuable
reason. It all seems like marketing hype.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
I've worked on projects with tremendous benefit, built with emphasis
on simplicity from their inception. In contrast, I have worked on
several projects, seemingly more now than ever before, that feel like
they have embraced complexity for its own sake.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
So yeah, I totally embrace anti-complexity and minimalism as much as
possible, and cannot seem to get much traction with many other
developers on that, at least until they have seen for themselves the
consequences. There is too much fear in our industry - losing a job is
such anxiety, so people choose "job-security" approaches - unnecessary
complexity, too many frameworks and tools - because on the surface
that looks good for a resume. To the detriment of quality on projects.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
I have gone down this road, I am in the midst of developing an
application with these concepts in mind, and am finding that the
overall experience is quite good. Most of what the frameworks provide
just fade into the background, and I mostly just focus on the
business logic. It does require having a decent understanding of the
foundations of work - for example if one is doing web development, one
should have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and HTTP. Some
frameworks try to abstract that all away, but it is inevitably
necessary to understand what is happening at those levels in order to
best handle maintenance and debugging.
