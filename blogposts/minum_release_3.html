	<p>
	Minum is a minimalist web framework written in Java, developed
	over five years by a TDD practitioner of fourteen years
	experience. Provides an all-in-one foundation for a
	highly-maintainable single binary web application. For TDD, by
	TDD.

	<ul>
		<li>
	Has its own web server, endpoint routing, logging, templating
	engine, html parser, assertions framework, and database
		</li>

		<li>
	Has nearly 100% test coverage that runs in 30 seconds and does
	not require any special setup (make test_coverage)
		</li>

		<li>
	Has nearly 100% mutation test coverage, using the PiTest tool.
	(make mutation_test)
		</li>

		<li>
	Relies on no dependencies other than the Java 21 SDK - No
	Netty, Jetty, Tomcat, Log4j, Hibernate, MySql, etc.
		</li>

		<li>
	Written from scratch
		</li>

		<li>
	Well-documented throughout
		</li>

		<li>
	Cleverness avoided* where possible
		</li>

		<li>
	No reflection
		</li>

		<li>
	No annotations
		</li>

		<li>
	Uses no mocking framework - integration tests preferred,
	occasional use of simple interface mocks.
		</li>

		<li>
	Has examples of framework use:
		</li>
		<ul>
			<li>
		a tiny project, as the basis to get started
			</li>
			<li>
		a small project, showing some minimal use cases
			</li>
			<li>
		a full application demonstrating realistic usage
			</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>

	<p>
	This framework enables high-maintainability through minimalism
	and simplicity. Developers using this framework will achieve
	the most benefit if they are of a similar mindset. Frameworks
	like Spring, which provide capabilities as large blocks with
	high guardrails, offer a different paradigm.

	<h3>FAQ:</h3>

	<p>
	<em>
	Are you saying we shouldn't be using Spring?
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	No, I am not saying that. However, there is need for a
	minimalist web framework. You can build a fully-functioning
	web application with high sophistication with either Spring or
	Minum, but Minum is five thousand lines of code and Spring is
	a million. For quality-oriented long-view practitioners, the
	benefits of minimalism outweigh its drawbacks.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>
	Yet another minimalistic framework? Why??
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	This is a misunderstanding - Minum is five thousand lines of
	code - the "minimalist" competitors range from 400,000 to
	700,000 lines when accounting for their dependencies. I have
	not found a similar project.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>
	What is the point of minimalism?
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	Easier debugging, maintainability, lower overall cost. Most
	frameworks trade faster start-up for a higher overall cost. If
	you need sustainable quality, the software must be well-tested
	and documented from the onset.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>
	Why not just use Java's built-in httpserver?
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	httpserver is larger and more complex, consisting of 6000
	lines versus Minum's 1800.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are no easily-available fast and thorough tests on
	httpserver, ruling out fearless refactoring.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are examples of sophisticated web applications in Minum.
	</p>

	<p>
	All the components in Minum work in tandem to support a web application.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>
	In your templating engine, where is the logic (e.g. looping,
	escaping, etc)?
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	It does not exist - logic-free templating was intentionally
	chosen. Any logic must be written explicitly as code, which
	makes maintenance easier.
	</p>

	<p>
	<em>
	Does it provide HTTP v2? Web sockets?
	</em>
	</p>

	<p>
	It currently does not. Those features may be built in the
	future. The choice was made to minimize scope for now.
	</p>



	<p>
	* Due to the necessities of structuring a web server for
	test-driven development, some parts of the socket / http
	handling code had to be written a bit more cleverly than
	preferred.
