There are so many essays written on how simplicity should be favored over
complexity.  That microservices, Kubernetes, and even the use of separate
frontend applications (rather than using server-side rendering) are overkill
for most projects.  
</p>

<p class="content-body">
With those ideas as the guiding star, <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a> began
development in December of 2021. Version 1.0.0 was released almost a
year ago, and the project has entered a state of stability.  The
primary focus remains making available a zero-dependency minimalist
Java web framework for developers of monolithic, server-side-rendered web
applications.

if any of this piqued your interest.  I would certainly value the
insight of other practitioners.

	The audit revealed an interesting pattern, where many startups
	experienced a sort of collective imposter syndrome while building
	straight-forward, simple, performant systems. There is a stigma
	attached to not starting out with microservices on day one - no matter
	the problem. “Everyone is doing microservices, yet we have a single
	Django monolith maintained by just a few engineers, and a MySQL
	instance - what are we doing wrong?”. The answer is almost always
	“nothing”.

	It can be amazing how far a small set of technology choices
	can go. The answer to this question in practice is almost
	never “we can’t do it,” it’s usually just somewhere on the
	spectrum of “well, we could do it, but it would be too hard”
	[4]. If you think you can’t accomplish your goals with what
	you’ve got now, you are probably just not thinking creatively
	enough.

	StackOverflow uses ASP.NET. So you can complain all day about
	public static void main, but have fun setting up 500 servers.
	The downsides of dynamic languages are real, expensive, and
	permanent.

	There is even more time spent on simply understanding the
	system, which could better be spent continuing to develop it.
	While I would never tell any engineer that time spent
	understanding a system is time wasted, I would definitely warn
	people away from prematurely adding these levels of complexity
	until they know they need it.

	People newer to the industry might never have built a server-side
	rendered app, so it's not an open question for them. As a result, for
	most client-side rendering is uncontroversially the 'right' way to
	build software.

	I think they're wrong: server-side rendering is more often the better
	choice.

<a href="https://www.simplethread.com/gasp-you-might-not-need-microservices/" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">
	By adopting Microservices or micro-frontends, you’re shifting the
	complexity, not removing it. In some places the shift is worth it, but
	if your system isn’t large enough, your teams aren’t numerous enough,
	and the problems you’re facing aren’t coming from coordinating huge
	numbers of developers, then splitting your application up into lots of
	tiny pieces will likely create more headaches than it eliminates.

	Simple designs for a racing car offer a huge advantage over
	complicated rivals, because they are easier to maintain. A complicated
	design has more things that can go wrong, and when they do go wrong it
	is more difficult to design and fix. This should be painfully familiar
	to anyone working in software engineering, and yet as a whole we keep
	producing over-complicated solutions.

<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;">
	This premium, essentially the cost of managing a suite of
	services, will slow down a team, favoring a monolith for
	simpler applications. This leads to a powerful argument for a
	monolith-first strategy, where you should build a new
	application as a monolith initially, even if you think it's
	likely that it will benefit from a microservices architecture
	later on.
