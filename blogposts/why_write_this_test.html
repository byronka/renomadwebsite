		Why write this test?

	Why should I write an automated test?

	<ul>
		<li>to give myself a way to play with the code now</li>
		<li>to provide an easy way to investigate the code in the future</li>
		<li>to suss out any mistakes in a small knot of complex logic</li>
		<li>to force myself to think deeply about the code under test - only a test can cause one to continue looking at code past the point of boredom, which is necessary to find the nuanced bugs</li>
		<li>to continue asserting correct behavior long after one forgets about the code (and after leaving the project)</li>
		<li>to provide a dynamic documentation on intention</li>
		<li>to allow early performance testing (loop it a million times and see how long it takes)</li>
		<li>to sharpen my thinking about how this program will be used, how it could go wrong</li>
		<li>to force the contract to be as simple as possible.  If it is hard to test, it will be hard to maintain and debug as well.</li>
	</ul>

	When might I not write an automated test?
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	<ul>
		<li>it will interfere with my flow and I cannot think of a quick way to get a test on it.  Especially so when I'm working on a very unknown domain and/or technology.</li>
		<li>I am working with a complex stateful machine with a difficult interface, and the time to write a proper test would be exorbitant.  Examples: database procedures, some fiddly web browser behaviors.</li>
		<li>when the coding is purely cosmetic or prose</li>
		<li>when I have sufficient initial tests. </li>
		<li>when refactoring code that has good tests</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Believe it or not, there is a moderation to be had in testing - each new test carries weight and requires maintenance.  The goal is to have the fewest tests with the best results.
