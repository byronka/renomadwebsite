		Stacktrace comparison	
	<p>
	<div class="date">September 29, 2024</div>

	<p class="content-body">
	This compares the stacktraces of Minum and Spring.  I have
	highlighted different sections by package.  Note the relative
	simplicity from Minum.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	In Minum's stacktrace, there are three sections.  From top to
	bottom, they are: the business code (1 line), then the Minum
	framework (6 lines), and finally the base Java code (3 lines).
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	In comparison, in Spring, there are 10 sections.  From top to
	bottom, they are: the business code (1 line), then a Spring
	"CrashController" (1 line), then some Java reflection code (2
	lines), then 10 lines of Spring framework code, then a single
	line of Jakarta's code for servlets, then back to Spring for
	one line, then back to the servlet for a line.  Then around 30
	lines of Tomcat code, with some Spring Framework middleware
	(aka filters) sprinkled liberally, then the Coyote processor
	package, then back to Tomcat for 5 lines, and finally a single
	line of base Java.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Which all shows that understanding the mechanics in Spring is
	going to require magnitudes greater research and effort than Minum.

		Causing the exception in Spring

	<p class="content-body">
	To cause the exception in Spring, I started the Spring
	Petclinic application and clicked on the Error link.  The
	stacktrace appears as formatted text in the logs.

	<h4>
		Causing the exception in Minum
	</h4>
	<p class="content-body">
	To cause the exception for Minum, I ran <pre>make run_sampledomain</pre> on the command line in the root
	directory, and then requested a URL with a path of
	<em>throwexception</em>. The stacktrace appears as a single
	log line, with formatting escape codes like \n.  These values
	can be replaced to see the original
	formatting, and tools like Intellij have an "Analyze Stack
	Trace" feature with a "Normalize" function that can
	automatically replace these values with formatting.
