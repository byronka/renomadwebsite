    I was thinking about one of my first algorithms, one to write all
    the lines of text that will ever be written in this universe.
  </p>
    <div class="date">June 6, 2014</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    Books typically contain pages, having lines of text.  Each line is around,
    let's say, 60 characters.  We can print out every permutation of 
    symbols (letters, numbers, and so on) for each character on the line,
    resulting in every possible line that will ever be written.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    The result will look something like this:
  </p>
  <br />
  <pre class="language-"
>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaac

... (billions and billions of lines later) ...

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
</pre>
  <br />
  <p class="content-body">
    To go through 72 characters (all the lowercase, the uppercase, the
    digits, common symbols and whitespace) for 60 elements in a row,
    is 72^60, or approx. 2.75e+111.  
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    To give you a sense of how big that is, if we were to distribute this task amongst 
    every atom in the universe, each printing 
    a billion lines a second since the beginning of the universe, we would now
    be at a thousandth of the way done.
  </p>
  <p class="content-subheader">Python for-loop approach</p>
  <p class="content-body">
    The first time I wrote this, I did it the most naive way; I just
    created a huge nested set of <em>for</em> loops, in Python.  
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    It was about 60 lines long and the indentation made it hard to read,
    but it worked:
  </p>
  <br />
<pre><code style="height: 400px" class="language-python">
# all the characters we need are from 0x20 to 0x7a
a = range(0x20,0x7a)
for a1 in a:
    for a2 in a:
        for a3 in a:

            #... (57 lines later) ...

            for a60 in a:
                print chr(a1) + chr(a2) + ... + chr(a60)
#^--------------^
  #60 x 4 = 240 spaces!

  <p class="content-subheader">C# Object-oriented approach</p>
  <p class="content-body">
    More recently I looked at simplifying and shortening the code.
    Following uses basic object-oriented principles to create an element
    within the line that rotates itself, and then rotates its neighbor
    when it resets.

    To develop a more elegant solution, I turned to our modern Lisp...
    JavaScript.  The implementation below works, but should be converted
    to C to handle its memory footprint.  It uses nesting to avoid the
    multiple nested for loops.

    Here it is in C:

  basically what we do here is we recursively call this just to have 
  a mechanism to control moving along the string.

  Essentially, when universalAuthor gets called, it will keep calling
  itself until n is 0, the left-most part of the string, at which point 
  we go through the for-loop on all the characters in the ASCII table 
  from 32 to 127 for the first (0) character in the array.

  Once we have hit the last character (127), we step out one level of nesting
  in the recursion, make it one character higher, and then dip back down to 
  the first index (0) in the string and update that in a fast loop.

  so to repeat, we are using the nesting of recursion as the mechanism that
  controls what part of the string we are looking at.  Then we are using the 
  for loop to loop through characters at a given point.
