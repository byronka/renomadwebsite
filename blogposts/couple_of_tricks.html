<div class="entry">
  <p class="content-header">
    A couple of tricks that make my life easier:
  </p>
  <div class="date">May 23, 2014</div>
  <div class="content-subheader">Scope highlight in Visual Studio</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    If you are using ReSharper with VS, in ReSharper's options, go to
    Environment >> Editor >> Editor Appearance, and under Highlightings
    select Highlight with "outline".  This will give you a much better
    sense of the scope of whatever you are looking at, whether that is
    code or markup.
  </p>
  <div class="content-subheader">File list oneliner</div>
  <p class="content-body"> 
    In *nix, try this oneliner for listing files in a directory
    by size (especially handy for looking at log directories,
    for example):
  </p>

  <br />
  <pre>
  <code 
     class="language-bash content-body">ls -l |egrep log$ | awk '{if($5 > 300) print $5 " " $9}'
</code></pre>
  <br />

  <p class="content-body">
    This can be customized.  It currently looks for any files ending with "log"
    and looks at the fifth column (size in bytes) and only prints it
    if the size is greater than 300.
  </p>
