    Building a case for why JavaScript needs to die. Part 1.
  </p>
  <div class="date">June 16, 2016</div>
  <p class="content-body">
  as we all know, JavaScript looks like C-based languages with its 
  use of brackets.  It seems to follow C convention - 
<pre><code class="language-javascript">for() {

}

while() {

}
</code></pre>
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
But of course, those in the know are aware that it's a lie.  Anything
in those brackets is simply in the same scope as whatever surrounds
them.  And that is the *only* reason for suggesting to use
functional-style methods like forEach() or map().  Because by using
those, you pop in a function (aka lambda, aka callback) as a
parameter, and that causes the scope to be contained.  
</p>

  <p class="content-body">
But the fact that you have to use a user-created function to have any
semblance of the proper way of doing things is a totally contrary
thing to have.  It's absurd.  It's like we're using some half-baked
intentionally shit language just so we can show off how masochistic we
are.
