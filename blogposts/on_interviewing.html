The patterns have been terrible for so long in this industry, people
have forgotten that a good interview can just be a casual conversation
about a person’s work history. It is not necessary to verify
the extent of a person’s capability during an interview, nor is
it feasible. There is always an element of luck and risk, no matter
what you do.  You may as well not inflict suffering on candidates.

Not to mention that as an experienced developer, I am interviewing the
company as well, and interviewers that delight in distressing me are not
getting first dibs.

Regarding the common retort, “but most people can’t even program, trust me”.
Bull.  Most companies (and interviewers) create an environment of fear and
stress.  Good code is less likely to happen when someone has you under the hot
glare of interrogation.
