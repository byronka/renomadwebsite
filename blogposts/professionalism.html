		On professionalism in the programming industry

<p class="content-body">
Not many of you have been professionals in a wholly different field. I
was a licensed architect before I became a programmer. Think bricks,
steel, cranes.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
We had ways of executing our work that would seem strange to an
outsider. Even to a neophyte designer. But they worked - and the risk
of failure and history of our profession ensured that we would
continue to pass down those strange but correct ways of working.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
In software, like any other knowledge-based endeavor, there is a
wisdom that takes time and repeated failures to carefully develop.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
That wisdom was named agile.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
In bricks and steel architecture, there are state laws and
organizations like NCARB that ensure all licensed architects will
acquire that knowledge. There is a mandated internship process for the
experienced architects to bring new people into the fold. Because the
cost and risk are so high (people dying in fire, etc), it is
incredibly important to continue passing that wisdom along.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
Programming, however, is still an immature industry, lurching from one
short-lived trend to another. The concept of carefully building
long-lasting systems is a pipe dream for a huge percentage of our
industry. Unfortunately, ambitious people sensed an opportunity to
exploit the nascent agile and bundled a flashy but deeply flawed
shallow version to anyone willing to pay, even though they had not
acquired the hard-won wisdom themselves.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
Management doesn't know any better. Business is interested in
business, and since they are very often in direct control of how the
programmers behave themselves, they do not realize what they are
foisting on their technologists.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
Each new generation comes along, finds themselves essentially unled,
learns the wisdom the hard way, only to move out of the practice of
programming and into management, at which point a new generation
arrives. Rinse and repeat. When I say they learn it the hard way, I
mean it takes years or even decades for mindful people to slowly
experiment through trial and error to an improved path.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
Our industry will continue along its lurching path until an external
force imposes itself. At one point, engineers and architects did not
need a license. Look up "Engineer's ring" on wikipedia. That
summarizes the seriousness of their obligation.
