What sets Minum apart?

<p class="content-body">
To those programmers who yearn for minimalism, and think
highly of Java, I would like to clue you in to a framework I
am maintaining. It is called <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a>, and it has everything
necessary to build a website. It is based on a preference to
spend extra time at the onset, to avoid common maintenance
difficulties later.

What sets Minum apart
</p>

<p class="content-body">
A website has typical components:
</p>

<p class="content-body">
<ol>
	<li>A web server: for transmitting data using correct
		protocol.</li>
	<li>Routing: for conveying data from the web to the business
		code and back.</li>
	<li>A database: for persisting data in an organized way to disk.</li>
	<li>Logging: to consistently generate runtime output.</li>
	<li>Templating: Inserting data into outgoing documents, like HTML.</li>
	<li>Testing: to test out parts of the program.</li>
	<li>Background job processing.</li>
	<li>HTML parsing</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Minum contains all these, _without having any third-party dependencies._
</p>

<p class="content-body">
There are many Java web frameworks using adjectives like lightweight,
micro, minimalist, and simple.  However, it is hard to find one that
takes those ideas to their logical conclusion.  Minum was written from
scratch, with minimalism as its north star.  There are no third-party
dependencies other than the JDK itself!
</p>

<p class="content-body">
For those not yet on the minimalism train, you might be wondering...
why.  
</p>

<p class="content-body">
When you encounter difficulty with dependencies, what is your
likeliest course of action? Maybe reviewing the documentation (if it
exists) or online forums.  Barring that, it may be necessary to read
the code.  It is often difficult to achieve a confident result when
reading the code of a project that (including dependencies) is
hundreds of thousands of lines. Let me write that a different way, just
to make sure it is clear.  Most of the so-called "minimalist" web
frameworks are between 400,000 and 700,000 lines of code when you account
for the lines of code of the dependencies necessary for a fully-fledged 
outcome, and that is being conservative - databases are routinely more
than a million lines of code. </p>

<p class="content-body">
Imagine instead that all the code for those components was a total of
4000 lines of code.  Then, if something misbehaves, there is a much
higher likelihood you can find the issue.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Another point: Many professional projects enter a period of high churn
and poor quality once they get past their early days.  Just my
opinion: a lot of the mindshare in our industry right now is on
techniques and technologies that give high returns at the onset, for a
high maintenance cost later.  Of course I cannot speak for everyone's
situation, but I have seen this enough times in my career to hop on
the minimalism bandwagon.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Great effort was put towards testing and documentation.  It is
possible to verify the system for yourself upon download from Github,
merely by running "mvn test" - it should take less than 15 seconds.

An example of a larger-than-toy application is available for
review at https://github.com/byronka/large_sample_project

Minum requires Java 21.
