		New Guide to Contributions for Minum

<p class="content-body">
I keep reading essays (see notes below) how simplicity should be favored over
complexity.  That microservices and Kubernetes are overkill for most projects.
Why choose undue complexity needlessly, why not keep things simple?
</p>

<p class="content-body">
For that reason, <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a>,
began development in December of 2021, embracing simplicity as its
guiding star.  Version one was released almost a year ago, and the
project has entered a state of stability.  The focus is providing a
zero-dependency web framework for developers of monolithic,
server-side-rendered web applications.  
</p>

<p class="content-body">
I have recently added a <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guide on making contributions</a> to the project,
if any of this piqued your interest.  I would certainly value the
insight of other practitioners.
