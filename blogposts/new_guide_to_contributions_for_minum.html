I keep reading essays online (see notes below) how simplicity should
be favored over complexity.  That microservices and Kubernetes are
overkill for most projects, all of which rings true with me.  Why
embrace undue complexity needlessly, why not keep things simple?

In 2018, I needed some software for demonstrating the industry's best
practices for students.  Our company's existing software was
insufficient to teach from, which drove me to build a <a href="https://github.com/7ep/demo">new project</a>.  
This turned out to be an incredible opportunity to play with many of the prominent
quality engineering ideas in the programming industry.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Around 2020, some colleagues and I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/7ep/r3z">timekeeping web application from
scratch</a> to play out these ideas in an experimental manner. We wondered
how feasible it was to follow the spirit of the most ideal
recommendations.

That program, called <a
href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a>, began development
in December of 2021.  Version 1 was released almost a year ago, and
the project has entered a state of stability.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
I have recently added a <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guide on making contributions</a> to the project,
if any of this piqued your interest.  I would certainly value the
insight of other practitioners.
