<p class="content-body">
I keep reading essays online (see notes below) how simplicity should
be favored over complexity.  That microservices and Kubernetes are
overkill for most projects, all of which rings true with me.  Why
embrace undue complexity needlessly, why not keep things simple?
</p>

<p class="content-body">
In 2018, I needed some software for demonstrating the industry's best
practices for students.  Our company's existing software was
insufficient to teach from, which drove me to build a <a
href="https://github.com/7ep/demo">new project</a>.  This turned out
to be an incredible opportunity to play with many of the prominent
quality engineering ideas in the programming industry. Although I had
been a practitioner for years at that point, this was a pivot to
focusing on quality from a standpoint of theory and simplicity.

<p class="content-body">
Around 2020, I requested time from my company to work with colleagues
on a project to explore better process. The result was this <a href="https://github.com/7ep/r3z">timekeeping web application from scratch</a>. 
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Afterwards, my colleague Matt suggested that it would be valuable for
the generally useful code to be split out to its own project.  The
common parts were components like the web server, the utilities, the
database, and other aspects.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
That program, called <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a>, began
development in December of 2021. Great emphasis was placed on avoiding
cleverness and embracing simplicity as the guiding star.  Version 1
was released almost a year ago, and the project has entered a state of
stability.  The focus is providing a web framework for developers of
monolithic, server-side-rendered web applications.  In some ways, this
project is a rebuke of the prevalence of microservices complexity-oriented
approaches.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
I have recently added a <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guide on making contributions</a> to the project,
if any of this piqued your interest.  I would certainly value the
insight of other practitioners.
