		Benefits of code coverage tools

<p class="content-body">
Code coverage tools are beneficial for developers, but it is
surrounded by misunderstandings.  A requirement for a particular
code-coverage percentage, such as 80%, is imposed on teams by
well-meaning managers, and sometimes by developers who have not spent
the time to understand how it would be valuable.

<p class="content-body">
Here are some real benefits to code coverage tools.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	Find the code we forgot to test
	</li>
	<li>
	Point out unreachable code due to logical fallacies (for example, a
	statement to handle a condition when the value is null, but value can
	never be null)
	</li>
	<li>
	The focus it applies to small bits of code can highlight unexpected
	issues
	</li>
	<li>
	Can highlight areas of unnecessary complexity - when providing greater
	coverage for code is overly difficult, a simpler coding approach may
	enable fuller testing (and be more maintainable).
	</li>
</ol>
