    I was recently asked what a left join was.  If you use SQL with
    any regularity, this is a handy concept to have in your toolset.

    Venn diagrams and mathematics are clear to some, but following is
    the way I think about these joins.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    To explain Left Join best, I will start with the standard Join, the
    Inner Join.
  </p>

  <div class="content-subheader">Inner Join (a regular join)</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    Link up the tables on each match.  Anything that doesn't match,
    don't include.  Note the following gotcha, given as a concrete example:
    if you are joining on a column in table A having three rows with
    the number 5 in them, against a column in table B having two rows
    with the number 5, you will get a resultant table with six rows (3
    times 2).
  </p>

  <div class="content-subheader">Left Join</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    To understand this best, just realize it is a regular Inner Join
    like already mentioned, except that it will also include any rows
    from the left table that were excluded from the Join.  The left
    table just means the table you are starting with.  That is, in

  <br />
  <pre><code class=" language-sql content-body">SELECT * FROM t1
JOIN t2 
ON t1.a = t2.a
</code></pre>
  <br />

  <p class="content-body">
    t1 is the left table (you are starting with that one.)
  </p>

  <div class="content-subheader">Right Join</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    Same as Left Join, just the right side.
  </p>

  <div class="content-subheader">Full Join</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    Same as Left and Right Join, just do both this time.
  </p>

  <div class="content-subheader">Cross Join</div>
  <p class="content-body">
    For every row in table 1, join it to every row
    in table 2.  If there are 5 rows in table 1 and 4 in table 2, you will
    get 20 rows. You do not need to indicate columns with this Join.
