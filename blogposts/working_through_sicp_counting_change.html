   Working through the SICP (Structured Interpretation of Computer
Programs): Counting change
	</p>
  <div class="date">April 17, 2016</div>
  <p class="content-body">
		I've read the beginnings of SICP many times.  I never seem to get
too far - usually I'm diverted by some change of view or a new interest.
	Maybe I'll never get to the end - it's hard to say.  
</p>
<p class="content-body">
In any case,
I'm working through it again right now and this time, I'm not allowing
myself to go one iota past anything that confuses me.  That is, if I
feel even the <em>least</em> bit confused on a topic, example, or
problem, I will work on it until it is crystal clear.  In fact, I
think this issue is one of the major problems with self-study from written 
works - they
don't always give a good indication of how much difficulty they ought
to be for the average reader.  And that can be intimidating and
demoralizing for students. I mean, is it expected to have to spend a
week on a single problem for it to become clear? 
</p>
<p class="content-body"> For better or worse,
I count myself amongst the middle of the bell curve when it comes to
understanding new things.  I've seen other people who seem to
understand things right away.  Sometimes it's because they've been
exposed to that information before, or something very similar.
Rarely, it's because they're just that quick.  More commonly, they'll
pretend to understand, just to keep face.  But me, I like to truly
understand things at the gut level, or have a sense of why that's not
possible.

I bring this up because I've recently gotten stuck for the past week
on the "Counting Change" section of chapter 1.2.2 - the tree recursion
chapter. It starts like this:
</p>

<pre>
  It takes only a bit of cleverness to come up with the iterative
  Fibonacci algorithm.  In contrast, consider the following problem: How
  many different ways can we make change of $ 1.00, given half-dollars,
  quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies?  More generally, can we write a
  procedure to compute the number of ways to change any given amount of
  money?

  	 This problem has a simple solution as a recursive procedure.
  Suppose we think of the types of coins available as arranged in some
  order.  Then the following relation holds...

I read this section and saw words like "simple" and "easily" and felt
it like a slap to the face.  But I'm persistent, stupid, and angry, so
I stuck to this problem for the past week until I took it apart.  Here
is the break down:

Per SICP, 
   The number of ways to change amount A using N kinds of coins equals
<br>  
	 * the number of ways to change amount A using 
     all but the first kind of coin (7 ways in the example here) 
<br>  
     plus
<br>  
   * the number of ways to change amount A - D using 
     all N kinds of coins, where D is the denomination 
     of the first kind of coin. (10 ways here)

I suppose what drives me nuts about this section is this:  The
recursive relation is not, at all, obvious.  A person might initially
think so - it's certainly implied - it seems like maybe the reader
just isn't up to the task or something.  But as you can see above,
where I break it down entirely, this is not transparently plain.  Only
when I made things concrete and regimented did the rationale behind
things pop forward.

  <p class="content-body">
Especially in the case of a book where self-study is expected,
situations like this need to be more heavily documented, using
illustrations where necessary, to avoid causing stumbling blocks.
