		A minimalistic Java web framework

	I have published a stable Java web framework focusing on minimalism.

	<p class="content-body">
	You will be hard-pressed to find a modern web framework as
	single-mindedly focused on minimalism, simplicity, and
	ease-of-use.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	The first question I get asked about this is: "why would I use
	this? What differentiates it from the many other web
	frameworks available?".
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	The answer is: Probably, it is not for you.  This is a
	framework intended for the rare obsessive starving for minimalism
	in a baroque world. Conventional frameworks, like Spring Boot,
	put high guardrails around capabilities.  They embrace a
	paradigm of building blocks (e.g. "Transactional").  Most of
	the whirring parts are safely hidden away.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	This requires a large amount of code, which increases the
	complexity.  New concepts require reading copious
	documentation on each building block.  It also makes
	maintenance harder, since stacktraces will be made nearly
	useless by the hidden machinery, and a great deal of
	understanding will be obscured in the name of ease of use.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	In contrast, the Minum project follows the self-imposed
	constraint that smaller and lighter is better.  Being an
	advocate for software quality, I built a system replete with
	automated testing, documentation, code invariants, and
	examples.

	<p class="content-body">
	The goals of this software are to provide excellence in:
