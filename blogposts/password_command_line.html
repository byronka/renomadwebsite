  A simple one-liner to create strong passwords.

explanation:
  the first part, from "tr" to "unrandom", takes the random binary
  input from unrandom and deletes all input except the ascii
  characters that are printable (which comes from using the :graph:
  command).

  fold -w30
  Then we chop that down to just 75 characters, nearly filling a
  whole line.

  sed 's/ ...
  here we remove certain characters we don't want.  Specifically, we
  don't want any characters that would need to be escaped in xml,
  because I store my passwords in xml format.

  head -n10
  Get 10 lines of random text.
