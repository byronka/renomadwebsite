<p>Ingredients</p>
<pre>
    2 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
    1 medium onion, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch chunks
    1/2 to 1 pound boneless beef short ribs, cut in 1 1/2-inch chunks
    Pepper, to taste
    3/4 cup pearl barley
    1/3 cup dried kidney beans
    1/3 cup dried navy beans
    1/3 cup dried cranberry beans
    3 cups chicken or beef broth
    2 tablespoons honey or molasses
    2 tablespoons smoked paprika
    Salt to taste
</pre>

<p>Preparation</p>

<p>Line the bottom of a slow cooker with the potatoes, the onion and
then the short ribs, sprinkling the meat with pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Scatter the barley and the beans on top, then pour on the broth
and the honey or molasses. Sprinkle with the paprika and salt to
taste. Add enough water to cover all the ingredients. Cook on low for
12 to 15 hours, stirring occasionally (except during Shabbat, for
those who observe it), adding more water if necessary. The longer the
cholent cooks, the better it will be.</p>
