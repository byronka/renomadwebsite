	  Making persuasive arguments about subtle topics
  </p>

  <div class="date">September 1, 2022</div>

  <p class="content-body">
    When I make a persuasive argument, I want to boil things down to the
    simplest essence, so we can easily see one thing is better than
    another.  For a complex beast like programming, that is made much
    harder.  Each choice involves subtlety and context.  "Some things are
    marginally better than another, and only in certain cases, depending"
    rarely compels.

  <p class="content-body">
    The benefit of a particular approach may merely be ease of
    understanding, or ease of use.  These are some of the hardest
    arguments to make with less-experienced and young developers, because
    young developers are often fast-thinking with great powers of
    recollection.  Additionally, less-experienced developers may actively
    seek out complexity, conflating it with sophistication.  It is not 
    unlikely that when experienced developers
    raise these topics as a concern, they see them as a
    challenge to be overcome by their intellect.
  </p>

  <p class="content-body">
    It is difficult to make these cases because the less experienced
    have a simpler, more binary view of their world:  DRY (Don't Repeat
    Yourself) must be applied in all cases.  Always protect class
    properties with a getter and setter.  Never use goto.  Make everything
    as generic and abstract as possible.
  </p>

  <p class="content-body">
    There are numerous books, articles, and speakers promoting these
    simpler approaches. Audiences favor simpler, straightforward advice.
    All too often, recipients of this advice choose to take it as
    religious doctrine.  It is understandable.  In the complex world we
    inhabit, it is comforting to work with a smaller set of clear choices
    that many people share.  This, however, prevents having the necessary
    versatility to create a human-oriented software.

    "Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"

     -- from preface of "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"

  <p class="content-body">
    As an older developer, I have seen the consequences of systems that
    are built with an allowance for unnecessary complexity.  Sometimes the
    bill does not arrive for a long time - months or years. But it always
    does, contributing to the overall grinding state of the industry.  If
    you don't take care of these things as you go, you get to the state
    that John Gall alludes to in the famous "Gall's law":
  </p>

  <p class="content-body">
       A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved
       from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from
       scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You
       have to start over with a working simple system.
