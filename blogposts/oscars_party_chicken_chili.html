1 white onion, diced (about 2 cups)
2 yellow or orange bell peppers, seeded and diced (about 2 cups)
1.5 cups sliced fresh mushrooms
1 tbsp minced garlic
1 tbsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander

		1. Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pot or dutch oven over
		medium heat.  Add the chicken and season with 1 tsp salt.  Cook,
		turning the pieces, until lightly seared and opaque, about 5 minutes,
		then transfer to a plate.

		2. Add the onion, peppers, mushrooms, and garlic to the pan and cook
		on medium-low heat until soft, about 10 minutes.  Stir in the cumin,
		coriander, 1/2 tsp pepper, and cayenne, then the wine.  Bring to a
		simmer and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.

		to a gentle simmer, cover, reduce heat, and simmer unti the flavors
		have melded, about 30 minutes.  Remove from heat; stir in the hummus
		and lime juice.
