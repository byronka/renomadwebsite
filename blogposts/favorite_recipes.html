Prep Time 15 minutes mins
Cook Time 1 hour hr
Total Time 1 hour hr 15 minutes mins
Ingredients

    1 lb pasta corkscrew/cavatappi preferred
    1 lb mozzarella cheese
    1 lb colby jack cheese
    1/2 lb cheddar cheese sharp preferred
    1/4 tsp salt
    1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper
    1/2 tsp garlic powder
    1/2 tsp smoked paprika
    3 tbsp unsalted butter
    3 tbsp all purpose flour
    12 oz evaporated milk ~1 can
    2 cups heavy cream
    1 tbsp mustard Dijon preferred
</pre>
</p>
<ol>

<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Once at a rolling boil, add the pasta and cook it according to the package directions. When done, drain well.</li>
<li>While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta cooks, shred the cheese. Grate the cheese with the coarse side of a box grater. Once you finish grating, mix all the cheese together in a large bowl, then divide into two even portions and set aside.</li>
<li>Make the seasoning mix: in a small bowl, stir together the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and smoked paprika. Set it aside.</li>
<li>In a large pan, melt the butter over medium heat. When melted, add 1/2 of the seasoning mix. Stir, bringing out the aromatics. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until everything bubbles slightly and looks incorporated.</li>
<li>Slowly stream in the evaporated milk while whisking to ensure there are no lumps. Next, add the heavy cream, whisking constantly. Whisk in the Dijon and remaining seasoning mix. Let the sauce come to a simmer and thicken, giving it an occasional whisk.</li>
<li>Add HALF of the cheese. Turn the heat to low (or remove it from the heat if needed) and slowly melt in 1/2 of the cheese, handful by handful, making sure the cheese melts before adding more.</li>
<li>Stir in the drained pasta, making sure to coat all the noodles in sauce.</li>
<li>Grab your casserole dish and add 1/2 of the mac and cheese to the bottom of the dish, spreading evenly. Layer on 1/2 of the remaining cheese then the remaining mac and cheese.</li>
<li>Finish by evenly layering on the last of the shredded cheese.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the top melts and bubbles. Broil for 2 minutes to give it a crispy crust, the remove, let sit for a bit so you don’t burn yourself, scoop and enjoy!</li>
