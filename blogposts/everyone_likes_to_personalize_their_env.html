    Everyone likes to personalize their environment a little bit.

    I prefer a sparse environment for my command line.  Testing the
    experience of having no prompt, I had no idea when the system
    finished a command.  I could run the time(1) command every time,
    but being on a variety of systems as different users, in different
    directories, there is too much boilerplate.  The command prompt
    suits this purpose nicely.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    I wanted a simplistic way to show everything at once.  The only
    problem was that all the parts were not available.  Oh well, I can
    build my own pieces.
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
    Nearly everything I wanted was available as part of Bash.  The only piece
    missing was some code to show the current directory smarter. You 
    can either see the current working directory (for example, "byron"), or
    you can see the entire directory from the root ("/home/byron").  That
    is fine most of the time, but occasionally you will encounter something
    monstrous like "/usr/local/share/etc/rc.d/wow/this/is/a/long/directory".
    That will take up the entirety of the command line.

  <p class="content-body">
    I wrote the following python script to make the directory more terse; if
    the full path is below a certain number of characters, it will just
    show the path.  If longer, it will show only the first character of
    each directory before the current directory.

    immediate_dir=split_dir.pop()

        "/".join(map(getfirstletter, split_dir)) + \
        "/" + immediate_dir

  Once that is somewhere (maybe in your ~/bin directory) you can use it as 
  part of your prompt, aka your PS1 variable.  I added the following to my
  bashrc script:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">PS1="\n\d \@ \n\u@\h:\$(~/bin/concat_dir.py \w) \$ "</code></pre>
<p class="content-body">
  This gives me a command prompt like the following, if in a shallow path:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Sun Jul 06 08:24 PM 
byron@laser:/home/byron $ </code></pre>
<p class="content-body">
  Or the following if you are in a very deep path, or a path with large words:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Sun Jul 06 08:30 PM 
byron@laser:/u/l/s/d/d/website $ pwd
/usr/local/share/doc/docbook-xsl/website
</code></pre>
