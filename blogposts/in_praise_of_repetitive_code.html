	In praise of repetitive code

<p class="content-body">
	It is well known that programmers should avoid repeating themselves.
This is simply because when you need to change code, you would then
need to update each of the repetitions, with an increasing chance of
adding bugs with each change made.  Thus, mnenomics like <em>DRY</em>
or Don't Repeat Yourself.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
	However, what I often see is a reaction to that which goes too far
in the opposite direction.  I would call it premature optimization but
it's not really performance that's at stake.  It's more a premature
unification of code, and it prevents finding the best way to organize
the solution.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
	In my own practice, I strive for simplicity, clarity, and
transparency.  So when I am building something new or refactoring, I
write code as simple and repetitive as possible.  This benefits me in
multiple ways:
<ul class="content-body">
	<li>	I don't spend as much time worrying about the right
	way to do it, I just get it done.
	</li>
	<li>	
	The code is simpler because I am not aiming for any cleverness.
</li>
<li>	
	best of all, the patterns pop out at me by the repetition.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="content-body">
	Afterwards, I can use the obvious patterns to fold the repetitions
together into a single, non-repeating thing which handles all edge
cases properly.
